# Analyzing 110 years of Knoxville, Tennessee temperature data

For several years now, I’ve heard acquaintances lament: <i>We don’t have spring anymore.  We skip spring and go straight to summer.  I miss spring-like temperatures.</i>  To see if data supports this belief, I decided to analyze publicly available NOAA weather station data collected from 1910 - 2019 at the Knoxville, TN airport.

# Tools Used
* Data source. NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCN-D) via [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-dzppucmwfpuk4)
* Data engineering.  AWS S3, Glue Crawler, Athena.
* Data analysis. Jupyter Notebook, Python, pandas, seaborn

# Summary of Findings
* There is evidence to support the perception that summer-like temperatures from April 1 to May 31 have happened more frequently since 2008 in Knoxville, TN. 

# Getting Started
* Introduction in notebook contains reason for analysis, the terms used to define the bounds of the problem, and data source details.
